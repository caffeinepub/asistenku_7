  "summary": "The diff replaces the app routing with TanStack Router (RouterProvider/createRouter) and adds a NotFound UI, but it does not implement the requested React Router (BrowserRouter + single Routes) setup, nor the explicit \"*\" fallback route in App.tsx. It also modifies an internal register page despite the request to limit changes to routing stabilization and NotFound fallback.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-22",
      "requirement": "Refactor frontend/src/App.tsx to be a minimal, stable React Router entrypoint with exactly one BrowserRouter and exactly one Routes block; ensure \"/\" renders LandingPage.",
      "reason": "App.tsx uses TanStack Router (RouterProvider/createRouter) and contains no BrowserRouter or Routes block.",

      "requirement": "Add a \"*\" NotFound fallback route in frontend/src/App.tsx that renders the specified 404 card UI and a \"Kembali\" button navigating to \"/\".",
      "reason": "A NotFound component exists, but there is no React Router \"*\" route; instead a TanStack rootRoute.notFoundComponent is used, which does not satisfy the requested implementation details (\"*\" route in App.tsx).",

      "requirement": "Remove/avoid duplicate router providers/route trees/Routes blocks or dev-only code in frontend/src/App.tsx to prevent hangs/blank screens.",
      "reason": "The change does not follow the requested React Router simplification; it introduces a different router system (TanStack Router) rather than the specified single BrowserRouter + single Routes block approach.",

      "requirement": "Verify/fix all imports in frontend/src/App.tsx for correct relative paths and casing for route components (LandingPage, client/partner/internal pages).",
      "reason": "The diff does not show any explicit casing/path-fix work for React Router usage; instead it changes router libraries and uses TanStack Router-specific imports (e.g., @tanstack/react-router, Link) rather than validating React Router route component imports as requested.",

    {
      "description": "Modified InternalRegister page behavior/UI state handling (submitted state flow and navigation via TanStack useNavigate), despite scope limiting changes to routing stabilization and NotFound fallback.",
      "reason": "The request says not to add new features beyond routing stabilization/NotFound and not to change UI/copy within existing auth simulation pages except as required to keep routing functional; the diff includes a direct modification to InternalRegister.",
