  "summary": "The diff adds imports for the 7 dashboard components and defines createRoute entries for multiple dashboard paths in frontend/src/App.tsx, but the change set violates the constraint/AC that only App.tsx be modified. Additionally, the diff is truncated before showing the finance route completion and the routeTree.addChildren([...]) update, so it cannot be verified that all new routes are appended to the route tree as required.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Only `frontend/src/App.tsx` is changed; add new routes only via new createRoute definitions and appending them into `routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren([ ... ])` without refactoring.",
      "reason": "The diff shows additional modified files besides App.tsx, violating the 'only App.tsx is changed' acceptance criteria. Also, due to truncation, there is no visible evidence that the new route constants are appended into `routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren([ ... ])`.",
      "evidence": [

      "requirement": "All 7 new dashboard route constants are included in the `routeTree` children array (appended) so navigating to each path renders the corresponding component (not 404).",
      "reason": "Although several dashboard routes are defined in the visible portion, the file is truncated before showing the completion of `financeDashboardRoute` and any `routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren([ ... ])` section, so inclusion of all 7 routes in the route tree cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary.",
