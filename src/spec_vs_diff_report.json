SuperadminDashboard includes pendingUsers filtering, formatPrincipal truncation for display, handleCopy copying full text, and handleToggleStatus activating via setUserActiveStatus(..., true) then fetchUsers(). However, the diff is truncated before the Superadmin table/footer markup, and the workspace button navigation does not match the exact navigate(\"/path\") acceptance criteria. There is also evidence (from frontend-file-summaries.txt) of unrequested routing/UI changes and toast/toaster additions that violate constraints/non-goals.",
